This assignment focuses on the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, specifically class inheritance and modular programming. It consists of two tasks:

Question 1: University Course Catalog Management (5 Marks)
In this task, you will design a course catalog system using class inheritance. The base class, Course, will store general course details such as course code, course name, and credit hours. Two subclasses, CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse, will inherit from Course and introduce additional attributes to distinguish core courses (mandatory for a major) from elective courses (offering flexible learning options). This demonstrates the application of inheritance and specialized classes in Python.

Question 2: Employee Module (5 Marks)
In this task, you will create a Python module named employee.py containing a class Employee with attributes for name and salary along with methods to retrieve them. You will then write a separate program to import this module, create an instance of the Employee class, and display the stored data. This exercise emphasizes the importance of modular programming and code reusability.

Through these tasks, you will develop a deeper understanding of:

Class and Object Creation
Inheritance and Specialization
Modular Code Structure
Encapsulation of Data using Methods
By the end of this assignment, you will have a strong grasp of designing structured, reusable, and efficient object-oriented programs in Python.
